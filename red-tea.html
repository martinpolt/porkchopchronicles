            <h3>The Review</h3>

            <p>Tsim Sha Tsui can be a culinary minefield. For every hidden gem, there are about seventeen tourist traps serving overpriced mediocrity to unsuspecting visitors who don't know any better. So when a friend dragged me to Red Tea on Cameron Road, a street I'd walked past hundreds of times without ever venturing into, I'll admit I was skeptical. Even more so when I learned it was a chain. Chains, in my experience, usually mean consistency at the cost of soul.</p>

            <p>Reader, I was wrong. So wonderfully, deliciously wrong.</p>

            <p>Red Tea (紅茶冰室) has become something of a social media darling in Hong Kong's food scene, and for once, the hype is justified. With multiple locations across the city (there's another branch just down Cameron Road at 14B, and others scattered from Jordan to Mong Kok), they've figured out how to scale quality, something that eludes most cha chaan teng chains. The place is bright, buzzing, and perpetually packed. You'll probably share a table with strangers, orders need to happen fast, and food arrives even faster. This is Hong Kong dining at its most efficient.</p>

            <p>Let's start with the pork chop itself: it's huge. And I don't mean "generous portion" huge. I mean "did they accidentally give me two?" huge. The kind of pork chop that makes you question whether the pig had been hitting the gym. It sprawls across the plate with the confidence of someone who knows they're the main event.</p>

            <p class="intro-highlight">The breading has that perfect golden crust, and the meat inside stays juicy and tender, a combination that's harder to achieve than it sounds. Too many places either nail the crunch and dry out the pork, or keep the meat moist at the expense of a soggy coating. Red Tea threads that needle beautifully.</p>

            <p>Now, let's talk about the cheese. Oh, the cheese. It's properly charred on top, not just melted, but actually caramelized in spots, adding this wonderful bitter-sweet depth that cuts through the richness of everything else. You can tell they're not skimping on oven time here, and it shows.</p>

            <p>The tomato sauce is where this dish really shines. It's rich and tangy with a hint of sweetness, coating the rice without drowning it. There's actual tomato flavor here, not just that generic "red sauce" taste you get at lesser establishments.</p>

            <p>If I had to nitpick (and as a person who has made it my life's mission to rate pork chop rice, I feel obligated to), the rice itself is slightly on the dry side. It's not deal-breaker territory, and the generous sauce helps compensate, but a little more moisture in the base would elevate this from "excellent" to "transcendent."</p>

            <p>Side note: Red Tea is also famous for their bo lo yau (pineapple bun with a thick slab of butter), their signature cheese French toast, and their Hong Kong-style milk tea. If you're coming with friends, get the pineapple bun with red bean milk tea combo for around HK$30. It's practically a steal. The place opens at 6am and runs until 11pm, so whether you need a pre-work breakfast or a late-night comfort food fix, they've got you covered.</p>

            <h3>The Verdict</h3>

            <div class="verdict">
                <h3>Will I Go Back?</h3>
                <p>Absolutely. Already planning my next visit. This is the kind of place that restores your faith in Tsim Sha Tsui's food scene.</p>
