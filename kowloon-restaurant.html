                <h3>The Review</h3>

                <p>Kowloon Restaurant sits inside the Lokville Commercial Building on Lock Road, one of those Tsim Sha Tsui side streets that tourists walk past on their way to somewhere else. It's the kind of place you'd never stumble upon unless someone pointed you to it, or you got genuinely lost, which, in TST's labyrinth of side streets and shopping arcades, happens more often than anyone cares to admit.</p>

                <p>Let me address the service first, because it sets the tone for the whole experience. Lock Road sits right in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui's tourist belt, a stone's throw from Nathan Road and the heritage district, where the pavements are permanently crowded with visitors clutching shopping bags and Google Maps. Restaurants in this kind of location don't need to earn repeat customers. They just need to exist. The foot traffic alone guarantees a steady stream of diners who'll eat here once and never come back, and the staff at Kowloon Restaurant seem to have internalised this fact with remarkable clarity.</p>

                <p class="intro-highlight">Menus land on the table with a thud. Orders are taken with the enthusiasm of someone filling out tax forms. And if you dare ask a question about the menu, you'll receive the kind of withering look usually reserved for people who stand on the wrong side of the escalator. It's not just the standard Hong Kong brusqueness you learn to love; it's the specific indifference of a place that knows it doesn't have to try. When your restaurant is surrounded by a million tourists a day, charm becomes optional.</p>

                <p>Now, the pork chop. This is where things get interesting, and frankly, a bit conflicting.</p>

                <p>The portion is genuinely generous. We're talking a thick, substantial slab of pork that sprawls across the plate like it owns the place. In terms of sheer size and heft, this is the kind of pork chop that makes you feel like you're getting your money's worth. At HK$80, you are absolutely not being shortchanged on quantity. The thickness of the cut is particularly impressive, none of that paper-thin, hammered-flat business you get at places trying to make a small piece of meat look bigger than it is.</p>

                <p>The taste? Actually good. The meat is well-seasoned and tender inside. The tomato sauce strikes a reasonable balance between sweet and tangy. But the breading? Limp. Soggy. Zero crunch whatsoever. Whatever crispy coating this pork chop once had has been reduced to a sad, damp layer clinging to the meat like wet cardboard. On paper, this should be scoring considerably higher.</p>

                <p>But here's where it falls apart: the cheese. Oh, the cheese. Or rather, the cheese's absolute refusal to participate in what is supposed to be a baked dish. It sits there, pallid and barely warm, as if someone waved it in the general direction of an oven and called it a day. There's zero browning, zero caramelisation, zero of that glorious charred-cheese crackle that separates a good baked pork chop rice from a truly great one. It's just... melted. Reluctantly. Like a cheese that had places to be and couldn't stay long.</p>

                <p>And this leads me to my dark suspicion: the microwave. There's a telltale quality to the dish, a certain suspicious uniformity of temperature, a breading so thoroughly devoid of crunch it might as well not be there, a cheese situation that screams "we heated this up in about ninety seconds." I can't prove it. I don't have a forensic food lab at my disposal. But my pork-chop-seasoned instincts, honed over fifteen years and dozens of cha chaan tengs, are telling me this plate didn't see the inside of a proper oven for nearly long enough. If at all.</p>

                <p class="intro-highlight">The absence of any char is the real disappointment. After 2 Cafe converted me to the church of crispy burnt edges, eating a pork chop with absolutely no char whatsoever feels like listening to a song with no bass. Something fundamental is missing. The flavour is there, the portion is there, but the texture and that crucial top-layer magic? Nowhere to be found.</p>

                <p>The rice is decent enough, neither remarkable nor offensive, which in this context almost counts as a win. It holds the sauce well and provides a solid base. The tomato sauce, too, does its job competently. It's just that when the headline act, the glorious, supposedly baked cheese-and-pork-chop combination, arrives looking like it barely broke a sweat, everything else feels like it's propping up a missed opportunity.</p>

                <p>I should note that the restaurant itself is perfectly fine as a space. It's clean, reasonably comfortable, and offers that authentic TST cha chaan teng atmosphere that I've come to genuinely love: the clatter of dishes, the rapid-fire Cantonese between tables. All the greatest hits.</p>

                <h3>The Verdict</h3>

                <div class="verdict">
                    <h3>The Almost</h3>
                    <p>Kowloon Restaurant has the raw ingredients for something genuinely great: generous portions, decent flavours, and a price point that won't empty your wallet. But the execution falls short where it matters most. Invest in a proper oven, give that cheese the heat it deserves, and this could easily climb a couple of points. Until then, it remains a solid, frustrating "almost."</p>
