            <h3>The First Bite That Changed Everything</h3>

            <p>Moving to a new city always brings a lot of "first" moments. The first time you get hopelessly lost and somehow find your way back (in my case, discovering that "MTR" was not, in fact, a type of tea). The first time a cultural quirk catches you completely off guard (nobody warned me about the aggressive air conditioning in summer — I now travel with emergency cardigans). And then there's the first time you bite into an iconic local dish and suddenly understand why people fall in love with a place.</p>

            <p>For me, that moment happened in July 2010, in a cha chaan teng in Kennedy Town that has long since closed — a casualty of Hong Kong's ever-evolving food scene. I was fresh off the plane from France, still jet-lagged, still confused about why everyone kept asking if I wanted my drinks "hot or cold, with or without ice" as if these were life-altering decisions (spoiler: they are).</p>

            <p class="intro-highlight">I was with two colleagues — Andy and William — who had taken pity on the bewildered new guy and decided to introduce me to "real" Hong Kong food. We all worked at a small fintech firm that no longer exists (a story for another time), but that lunch would outlast the company by decades in my memory. They ordered for me. What arrived was a sizzling plate of something I'd never seen before: golden breaded pork, crimson tomato sauce, melted cheese bubbling at the edges, all perched atop a bed of slightly sticky rice.</p>

            <p>"Baked Pork Chop Rice," they said. "Very Hong Kong."</p>

            <p>I cut into the pork. The crunch of the breading gave way to tender meat. The tomato sauce was sweet and tangy in a way that felt familiar yet entirely new. And then came the moment that truly sealed the deal: my first sip of iced lemon tea.</p>

            <p class="intro-highlight">Let me tell you something about that iced lemon tea. In France, if you want a decent cold drink at a restaurant, you're looking at 5 euros minimum. Here I was, in this fluorescent-lit cha chaan teng, being handed a glass of the most refreshing, perfectly sweetened, ice-cold lemon tea I'd ever tasted — for about 10-15 Hong Kong dollars. That's less than 2 euros. I remember thinking: "I can have this. Every day. At every restaurant. For pocket change." It felt genuinely revolutionary. Like discovering a cheat code to happiness.</p>

            <p>That first sip, paired with that first bite of pork chop rice, hit me with the force of a revelation. Something clicked. Not just about the food, but about what life here could be like.</p>

            <p>This was home now. This strange, wonderful, humid, vertical city was going to be home. And this dish, this glorious fusion of East and West, crispy and saucy, familiar yet foreign — this was going to be my comfort food. And that iced lemon tea? That was going to be my daily companion through every humid summer, every late work night, every weekend adventure.</p>

            <h3>Fifteen Years Later</h3>

            <p>It's now 2026, and I'm still here. I've watched Hong Kong change in countless ways. I've hiked the Dragon's Back more times than I can count. I've gotten lost in the galleries of Wong Chuk Hang, discovered speakeasies in Sham Shui Po, and learned that the best views are often from the most unexpected MTR exits.</p>

            <p>But through it all, one thing has remained constant: my love for Baked Pork Chop Tomato Rice. Is it sophisticated? Absolutely not. Is it photogenic? Only in a "this looks like someone dropped a cheese bomb on my plate" kind of way. Is it the dish I crave when I've had a long day, when I'm feeling homesick for a home I've now lived in longer than the country I was born in? Every single time.</p>

            <h3>Why This Blog Exists</h3>

            <p>This website started as a joke. I'd been keeping mental notes of all the places I'd tried this dish, rating them in my head, arguing with friends about whether crispy edges on the pork were better than a perfectly even crust (they are, and I will die on this hill).</p>

            <p>Then one day, a friend said: "You should write this down. Make a blog or something."</p>

            <p>So here we are. The Pork Chop Chronicles: a deeply unnecessary, entirely self-indulgent documentation of one Frenchman's ongoing quest to rank every Baked Pork Chop Tomato Rice in Hong Kong.</p>

            <p>It's a work in progress. It's chaotic. It's probably never going to be finished because new cha chaan tengs keep opening and I keep finding new spots to try.</p>

            <p>It's life, really. Served on a sizzling plate, with a side of iced lemon tea.</p>
