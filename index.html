            <h2>Welcome to My Obsession</h2>

            <p class="intro-highlight">"You moved to Hong Kong and your favourite dish is... baked pork chop rice?" — Every French person I've ever met</p>

            <p>Yes. Yes, it is. And before you judge me, let me tell you: I've been living in Hong Kong since 2010, and in that time, I've hiked more mountains than I can count, discovered hidden art galleries in industrial buildings, and eaten my way through some of the finest dim sum this city has to offer. But nothing — absolutely nothing — makes me feel more at home than sitting in a slightly too-bright cha chaan teng, plastic chopsticks in hand, staring down at a sizzling plate of Baked Pork Chop Tomato Rice.</p>

            <p>The dish itself is beautifully simple: a breaded pork chop, lovingly placed atop a bed of rice, drowned in tomato sauce, buried under a blanket of melted cheese, and baked until the edges get that perfect char. It's comfort food. It's fusion cuisine before fusion cuisine was cool. It's Hong Kong on a plate.</p>

            <p>This website is my ongoing love letter to this humble dish. Every time I find a new place serving it, I document it here. Some are fantastic. Some are... educational experiences. All of them are part of my Hong Kong story.</p>

            <p>So grab a cup of milk tea (hot or iced, I won't judge), settle in, and join me on this deeply unnecessary but entirely delicious journey.</p>
